Currently I am interested in pursuing these research directions:

## Neural interfaces
Neural interfaces (brain computer interfaces and peripherical interfaces) to restore, rehabilitate motor functions and inform the neuroscience of sesnsorimotor control.

Research in the direction of developing bidirectional self-paced motor neural interfaces to restore lost function in neural injured states, such as stroke. 
Investigating multi-area BCI to better understand the network underlying naturalistic motor behavior, using high-neuron count, high bandwidth neural interfaces.

## Translational neuroengineering 
Scalable translational neuroengineering - tech first approach of developing bioelectric solutions to less focussed neuro/sleep disorders. 

Focus on indetifying the gaps between current therapeutics and the needs of patients suffering from neuro/sleep disorders; and devlop simple, scalable, patient first solutions which can be translated to commercialized products outside the lab.

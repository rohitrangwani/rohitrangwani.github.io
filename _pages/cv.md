Research experience
======
* Gulati Lab, CNSM, Cedars-Sinai, Los Angeles, CA, Sept 2021 – present
  • Working on subcortical cerebellar brain-machine interfaces for neuroprosthetic control
* Integrated Neuro-Prosthesis Lab, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, Aug 2018 - May 2020
  • Engaged in research on developing methods of sensory feedback/augmentation for robotic-human interfaces and neuroprosthetics
* MuSAE Lab, INRS-EMT, Montreal, Canada, May - July 2015
  • Utilized numPy, sklearn, etc. in python to design a self-paced Motor Imagery BCI system that can be used for real-time application without the need for extensive training (a few mins per user) or high computation power. Hacked an Emotiv Epoc+ for EEG acquisition in the sensorimotor area for easier online applications.

Work experience

## Cortico-cerbellar interaction underlying neuroprosthetic control

Can you use cerbellar neural activity for neuroprosthetic control?

In brain, mutliple regions cordinate their neural activity to achieve different motor tasks. Primary motor cortex has been the prinicipal site of interest for brain-machine interfaces in years of research. But other subcortical brain regions connected to motor cortex, and well known for their role in motor control, such as cerebellum are not validated for neuroprosthetic control.
This poses the question that can we use subcortical regions such as cerebellum for brain-machine interface when primary motor cortex is injured? Our work shows that cerebellum neural activity can be used for brain machine-interface in both healthy and stroke-injured motor cortex brain. 


## Sleep oscialltions post-stroke

Guess which topographical EEH map corresponds to healthy subject vs stroke patient?! Bonus points if you can guess which side the stroke is on.

Sleep is known to promote recovery post-stroke. This lead us to investigate sleep oscillations (which play important role in motor consolidation) in human patients post-stroke. Recent rodent work ([Kim et al 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124722001504)) showed that resurgence of physiologic spindles coupled to sleep slow oscillations(SOs) and concomitant decrease in pathological delta(δ) waves is associated with sustained motor performance gains during stroke recovery. This work classified SO-nested spindles as restorative post-stroke and δ-wave-nested spindles as pathological. We found that stroke subjects had pronounced asymmetry of these sleep oscillations, with a predominance of SOs, δ-waves, spindles and nested spindles in one hemisphere, when compared to the healthy subjects.  δ-wave nested spindle and SO-nested spindle along with medications can serve as important biomarkers to track motor recovery post-stroke. 

## Propioceptive modulation and augementation

Proprioceptive deficits resulting from neural injuries make it challenging for the nervous system to adapt to the compromised sensorimotor conditions. To address these proprioceptive deficits, several invasive and non-invasive approaches like vibration, electrical nerve stimulation, and skin stretch have been introduced. However, proprioceptive modulation is still challenging as the current solutions have limitations in terms of effectiveness, usability, and consistency. We proposed a new way of modulating proprioception using transcutaneous electrical stimulation and showed its efficacy in modulating propeiocetion and generating kinesthetic illusion.

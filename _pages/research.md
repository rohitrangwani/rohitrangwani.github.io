# Cerbellar brain-machine interface and cortico-cerbellar interaction underlying neuroprosthetic control

In brain, mutliple regions cordinate their neural activity to achieve different motor tasks. Primary motor cortex has been the prinicipal site of interest for brain-machine interfaces in years of research. But other subcortical brain regions connected to motor cortex and well known for their role in motor control, such as cerebellum are validated for neuroprosthetic control.
This posts a question can we use regions such as cerebellum for brain-machine interface when primary motor cortex is injured? Our work shows that cerebellum neural activity can be used for brain machine-interface in both healthy and stroke-injured motor cortex brain.

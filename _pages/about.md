Welcome! I am Rohit Rangwani. I am postdoctoral researcher working with [Dr. Cecile Verbaarschot](https://profiles.utsouthwestern.edu/profile/239528/cecile-verbaarschot.html) at Department of Neurological Surgery at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. I finished my Ph.D. in Neuroenigneering at the [Department of Bioengineering, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)](https://www.bioeng.ucla.edu/) and worked as a visiting graduate student at [Center for Neural Science and Medicine (CNSM), Cedars-Sinai](https://www.cedars-sinai.edu/research/areas/neural-science.html) during this period. My doctoral research work with [Dr. Tanuj Gulati](https://www.gulatilab.org/) focused on cerebellar brain-machine interfaces in healthy and stroke models to better understand the underlying cortico-cerebellar motor network in healthy vs stroke-injured brains. This was supported by the American Heart Association [predoctoral fellowship](https://professional.heart.org/en/research-programs/aha-funding-opportunities/predoctoral-fellowship). 

I am passionate about everything related to neuro and health tech. Over the course of my professional journey, I have gained diverse experience across academic and industry domains. I graduated with a master's degree in Electrical Engineering from [Texas A&M University, College Station](https://www.tamu.edu/index.html) and earned my bachelor of technology degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering  from [National Institute of Technology, Warangal, India](https://www.nitw.ac.in/). During my master's, I worked  at [Integrated Neuro-Prosthetics Lab(INPL)](https://www.hangue.com/home) developing novel ways of modulating/augmenting sensory feedback for improving rehabilitation and human-machine interfaces. Our [published work](https://jneuroengrehab.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12984-021-00870-y) establishes transcutaneous electrical stimulation as a novel method of modulating proprioception. Overall, I am interested in understanding the sensorimotor system's cortical and peripheral circuits to develop translational therapies for diseased neural states. To accomplish these goals, I have worked with intracortical recordings, EEG, EMG and different stimulation approaches.

In industry, I have worked in different software development roles at [Qualcomm](https://www.qualcomm.com/), [Samsung Advanced Computing Lab](https://semiconductor.samsung.com/us/about-us/us-office/us-r-and-d-labs/computing-lab-sarc-acl/), and [Canon Medical Research USA(CMRU)](https://www.research.us.medical.canon/).

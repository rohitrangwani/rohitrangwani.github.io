Welcome! I am Rohit Rangwani. I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [Department of Bioengineering, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)](https://www.bioeng.ucla.edu/) and a visiting graduate student at [Center for Neural Science and Medicine (CNSM), Cedars-Sinai](https://www.cedars-sinai.edu/research/areas/neural-science.html). I am currently working with Dr. Tanuj Gulati at [Gulati Lab](https://www.gulatilab.org/). My dissertation work focuses on cerebellar brain-machine interfaces in healthy and stroke models to better understand the underlying cortico-cerebellar motor network in healthy vs stroke-injured brain. 

I am passionate about everything related to neuro and health-tech. Over the course of my professional journey, I have gained diverse experience across academic and industry domains. I graduated with a master's degree in Electrical Engineering from [Texas A&M University, College Station](https://www.tamu.edu/index.html). I earned my bachelor of technology degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering  from [National Institute of Technology, Warangal, India](https://www.nitw.ac.in/). During my master's, I worked  at [Integrated Neuro-Prosthetics Lab(INPL)](https://www.hangue.com/home) developing novel ways of modulating/augmenting sensory feedback for improving rehabilitation and human-machine interfaces. [This](https://jneuroengrehab.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12984-021-00870-y) published work establishes transcutaneous electrical stimulation as a novel method of modulating proprioception. Overall, I am interested in understanding the sensorimotor system's cortical and peripheral circuits to develop translational therapies for diseased neural states. 

In industry, I have worked in different software development roles at [Qualcomm](https://www.qualcomm.com/), [Samsung Advanced Computing Lab](https://semiconductor.samsung.com/us/about-us/us-office/us-r-and-d-labs/computing-lab-sarc-acl/), and [Canon Medical Research USA(CMRU)](https://www.research.us.medical.canon/).
